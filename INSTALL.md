    - Drag dir to the side bar

3. Configure iTerm2
    - Preferences

    - I had to map it to return, then to escape, but it worked.

6. Use Karabiner to change the Pause key to Eject, so you can lock the screen
   when using an external keybaord.

7. Configure Spectacle to use all three meta keys for moving windows to the
   left half and right half.
