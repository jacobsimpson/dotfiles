# dotfiles

Basic home directory configuration for a Unix box. I try to keep everything in
here so I can easily check it out on a new machine and quickly configure it to
my tastes, as well as keep changes from various machines in sync. It has things
like:

- software installation
- Vim configuration
- shell configuration

To set this up on a new computer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jacobsimpson/dotfiles.git
dotfiles/install.sh
```
