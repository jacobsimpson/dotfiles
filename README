Basic home directory configuration for a Linux box. I try
to keep everything in here so I can easily check it out on
a new machine and quickly configure it to my tastes,
as well as keep changes from various machines in sync.

To set this up on a new computer:

# do the checkout.
git clone https://github.com/jacobsimpson/home-dir.git

# Run these lines to configure your environment to use the new checkout.
echo 'test -f ~/home-dir/bashrc && source ~/home-dir/bashrc' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/home-dir/.vim/myvimrc' > ~/.vimrc
echo '(load-library "~/home-dir/.emacs-packages/emacs")' > ~/.emacs
ln -nsf ~/home-dir/guile/guile-config.scm ~/.guile
